# autism-prediction-ML
This is my autism prediction machine learning model where i have used different python libraries along with some packages and modules.
In this ML model i have used three different ML algorithms, Decision Tree, XGBoost, and random forest. I have achieved an accuracy of 83% with XGBoost.
IN this project i have preprocessed data, did hyperparameter tuning and performed Exploratory Data Analsis.
THis project has helped me understand ML algorithms better and polished my skills in data preprocessing and visualisation.
